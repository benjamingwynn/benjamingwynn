#### Hey, you found my Github!

Here you'll find various hacky things and hopefully some interesting stuff too. A lot of what I work on here is internal/backend or web build system stuff, but I also sometimes build games or other intersting visual projects.

I mostly work with JavaScript based web stuff, preferably Svelte/Typescript/Node, but you'll find tools and programs for Android and Linux here too.
